# HelloPlugin
1. This is just a small sample project to show the communication between WebView and Android native through Cordova.
2. The user can input two numbers through the WebView and she will be able to see the summation of two input numbers calculated at Android native.
3. I did not take care of any edge cases like integer overflow, empty input and etc. at the moment.
